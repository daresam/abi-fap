                    I am a doctoral trained epidemiologist and health equity researcher with extensive experience in
                    the content areas of maternal and child health, reproductive justice, women's health and
                    structural and social determinants of health. I apply novel methods and approaches in
                    understanding, measuring and addressing racism, discrimination and other forms of oppression as
                    it relates to health and well-being over the life-course.

                    One my notable contributions to the field is the development of novel measures of institutional
                    racism in the form of "residential redlining" or home mortgage discrimination as key structural
                    determinants shaping residential segregation, neighborhood environments and health.

                    I have also been intimately engaged in co-leading equity efforts in the response to the global
                    pandemic of COVID-19. My research also includes place-based/neighborhood effects,
                    community-driven research approaches, ecological momentary assessment, program evaluation, mixed
                    methods and qualitative inquiry (e.g., oral history, ethnography, intensive interviewing).
